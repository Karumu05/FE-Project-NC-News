<h1>NC News Front-End</h1>

ðŸ”— https://nc-news-karumu.netlify.app/home

This repository holds the Front-End code for a news website. Users can explore and interact a vast collection of articles, refine their search by topic, sort results by various factors, and control the order. Registered users gain access to even more features: adding/deleting comments on articles and upvoting them to curate the content for the community. 

This app works from the News Back-end Application Programe Interface (API) I created. More info can be found here:
